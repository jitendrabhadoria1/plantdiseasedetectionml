# Plant Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Developed a convolutional neural network to predict plant leaf diseases using a publicly available dataset of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves taken under regulated conditions. Used multiple layers and hyperparameters to develop, train, and test this classification model.
